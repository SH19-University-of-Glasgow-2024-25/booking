### Known bugs
---
1) Sometimes when editing appointments or translations (any value including invoice generation flagging) results in a reordering of elements that causes your currently active appointment or translations moving to a random location on the page
2) When on the login page (logged out) the console shows multiple `Unauthorized` errors, this is due to elements on the page which need the user to be logged in polling the backend to check auth. This endpoint is protected for only authenticated users to be able to access, resulting in errors when logged out. This is purely visual.

### Features for future development
---
1) Auto populate fields with default values, this can be implemented by saving user inputs dynamically or add a features that allows users to  specify their default values, like location, preferences etc. and then fill in forms based on this information.
2) Users should be able to see more detailed information such as relevant user information when hovering such as contact details and such
3) Translation deadlines, when creating translations there is no ability to set a deadline, this would be very useful
4) Once an interpreter has translated a document there is no ability to upload the translated document back to the customer
5) The current languages available can only be generated by Django superuser or the population script, an ability for admins to add new languages should be added
